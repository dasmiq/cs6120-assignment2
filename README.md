# CS6120: Homework 2
## Predictive and Interpretive Text Classification

In this repository, there are two python notebook files, each of which contains half the assignment and its relevant instructions. Work through both of them, implementing the TODO items.

Start with reviews.ipynb and then do shakespeare.ipynb. You may work on them locally or click on the button to open and run the notebooks on Google Colab. When working in Colab, you may save your work by clicking on "Save in GitHub to keep changes."

When you are finished, save both notebooks as PDFs and submit to Gradescope.
